The returned output should be just the array of the counts because that is the only thing that will be adjusted. This means that after adjustment, the peak will not be at the same energy as it was before. Assuming detector drift is the problem, counts will drift from energy, so the result should be restored to what it would have been if drift had not occured. To make things simple I am going to shift based on index of the array, meaning the bins and energy arrays will not need to be given. \n",
